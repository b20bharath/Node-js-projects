/* 
commands to create package.json file which has all the npm modules that we can use in the project

1. node init 
   -> it create the notes-app package that has all the npm modules 

Now we will create a notes-app directory on which we can run install commands to install modules 

ex: install validator modules
    ../notes-app$ npm install validator@13.5.2

Now a node-modules folder will be created and package-lock.json file will be created

package-lock.json has the infomration about the version of dependencies installed

To import node modules in the js file we can write the code as follows
-> const validator = require('validator')

Before ES6, we have use require() for import modules 

From ES6, we can use 'import' command to import modules
ex: import validator from 'validator'
ex: import isEmail from 'validator/lib/isEmail'
